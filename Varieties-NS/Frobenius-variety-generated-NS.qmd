## Definition

The definition of Frobenius variety generated by a family of numerical semigroups comes from the following result.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
$\textbf{Proposition}$: The intersection of [Frobenius varieties](Frobenius-variety.qmd) is a Frobenius variety.
:::

Let $X$ be a family of [numerical semigroups](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd). It is defined the Frobenius variety generated by $X$ as the intersection of all Frobenius varieties containing $X$, and it is denoted by $\mathcal{F}(X)$. If it is defined the set

$$
Ch(X) = \bigcup_{S \in X} Ch(S),
$$

where $Ch(S)$ denotes the [chain associated to S](Chain-associated-NS.qmd), it can be proven that $\mathcal{F}(X)$ is the set of all finite intersections of elements in $Ch(X)$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $X = \{\langle 4,5,6 \rangle, \langle 3,4 \rangle, \langle 2, 7 \rangle\} = \{S_1, S_2, S_3\}$. It is easy to check that

$$
Ch(S_1) = \{S_1, \langle 4,5,6,7 \rangle, \langle 3,4,5 \rangle, \langle 2,3 \rangle, \mathbb{N}\},
$$

$$
Ch(S_2) = \{S_2, \langle 3,4,5 \rangle, \langle 2,3 \rangle, \mathbb{N}\},  Ch(S_3) = \{S_3, \langle 2,5 \rangle, \langle 2,3 \rangle, \mathbb{N}\}.
$$

Then,

$$
Ch(X) = \bigcup_{S \in X} Ch(S) = \{S_1, S_2, S_3, \langle 4,5,6,7 \rangle, \langle 3,4,5 \rangle, \langle 2,5 \rangle, \langle 2,3 \rangle, \mathbb{N} \},
$$

and $\mathcal{F}(X)$ is the set of all finite intersections of elements in $Ch(X)$.

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to Frobenius variety generated by a family of numerical semigroups.

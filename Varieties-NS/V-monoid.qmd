## Definition

Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a [Frobenius variety](Frobenius-variety.qmd). It is said that a submonoid $M$ of $\mathbb{N}$ is a $\mathcal{V}-$monoid if it can be expressed as the intersection of elements of $\mathcal{V}$.

It is deduced from the definition that the intersection of $\mathcal{V}-$monoids is a $\mathcal{V}-$monoid.

## Examples

$\circ$

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to $\mathcal{V}-$monoid.

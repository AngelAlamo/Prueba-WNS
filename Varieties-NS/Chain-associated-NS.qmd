## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) such that $S \ne \mathbb{N}$ and let $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{S})$ be the [directed graph of all numerical semigroups](Directed-graph-all-NS.qmd). If $F(T)$ denotes the [Frobenius number](../Basic-concepts/Frobenius-number.qmd) of any numerical semigroup $T$, the path

-   $S_0 = S$,

-   $S_{i+1} = \begin{cases} S_i \cup \{F(S_i)\} & \text{ if } S_i \ne \mathbb{N}, \\ \mathbb{N} & \text{ otherwise,}\end{cases}$

is well defined, since $S \cup \{F(S)\}$ is a numerical semigroup, and finite, since $\mathbb{N} \setminus S$ is finite. Then, there exists a positive integer $k$ so that

$$
S_0 \subsetneq S_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq S_k = \mathbb{N}.
$$ Moreover, this path connecting $S$ and $\mathbb{N}$ is unique. Then, it is defined the chain associated to $S$, denoted by $Ch(S)$, as

$$
Ch(S) = \{S_0, S_1, \ldots, S_k \}.
$$

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 3,5,7 \rangle$. Its Frobenius number is $F(S) = 4$ and $S_1 = S \cup \{4\} = \{0, 3, \rightarrow \} = \langle 3, 4, 5 \rangle$. Now, $F(S_1) = 2$ and $S_2 = S_1 \cup \{2\} = \{0, 2, \rightarrow\} = \langle 2, 3 \rangle$. Finally, $S_3 = S_2 \cup \{1\} = \mathbb{N}$. The chain associated to $S$ is

$$
Ch(S) = \{S_0, S_1, S_2, S_3\} = \{S, \langle 3,4,5 \rangle, \langle 2, 3 \rangle, \mathbb{N}\}.
$$

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to chain associated to a numerical semigroup.

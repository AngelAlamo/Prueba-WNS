## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) [minimally generated](../Basic-concepts/Minimal-set-of-generators.qmd) by $\{n_1, \ldots, n_p\}$, let $s \in S$, and let $\mathbf{Z}(s)$ be the [set of factorizations](../Presentations-NS/Set-of-factorizations.qmd) of $s$ in $S$. Given $x, y \in \mathbf{Z}(s)$, it is defined the distance between $x$ and $y$, denoted by $d(x,y)$, as

$$
d(x,y) = \max \{ | x - (x \land y) |, | y - (x \land y) | \}
$$

where $|x|$ is the [length](Length-factorization.qmd) of $x$ and $x \land y$ is the greatest common divisor of $x,y$, that is,

$$
x \land y = (\min \{x_1, y_1\}, \ldots, \min \{x_p, y_p\}).
$$

It can be proven that $d(x,y) = \max \{|x|, |y|\} - |x \land y|$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 7, 9, 14 \rangle$ and $s = 49$. The set of factorizations is $\mathbf{Z}(49) = \{(7,0,0), (1,3,1)\}$, and

$$
(7,0,0) \land (1,3,1) = (1,0,0).
$$ Therefore, the distance between the factorizations $(7,0,0)$ and $(1,3,1)$ is

$$
d((7,0,0), (1,3,1)) = \max \{ | x - (x \land y) |, | y - (x \land y) | \} = \max \{ 6, 4 \} = 4.
$$

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to distance between factorizations.

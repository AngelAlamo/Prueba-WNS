## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd), let $s \in S$ and let $\mathbf{Z}(s)$ be the [set of factorizations](../Presentations-NS/Set-of-factorizations.qmd) of $s$ in $S$. Given $x,y \in \mathbf{Z}(s)$ and a non-negative integer $N$, it is said that $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k \in \mathbb{Z}(s)$ is an $N-$chain joining $x$ and $y$ if

-   $x_1 = x$, $x_k = y$,

-   for all $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, k-1\}$, $d(x_i, x_{i+1}) \le N$, where $d(x_i, x_{i+1})$ denotes the [distance](Distance-factorizations.qmd) between $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 5, 12, 16 \rangle$ and $s = 70$. The set of factorizations is

$$
\mathbf{Z}(70) = \{(14, 0, 0), (2, 5, 0), (6, 2, 1), (2, 1, 3)\}.
$$

If we compute the distance between each pair, it is obtained the following graph.

```{dot}
graph  NSGraph{
1 [label=" (14, 0, 0)"];
2 [label=" (2, 5, 0)"];
3 [label=" (6, 2, 1)"];
4 [label=" (2, 1, 3)"];
2 -- 4[label="4" ];
2 -- 3[label="5" ];
3 -- 4[label="5" ];
1 -- 3[label="8" ];
1 -- 2[label="12" ];
1 -- 4[label="12" ];
}
```

Let us consider $x = (2,1,3)$ and $y = (14,0,0)$. We have an $8-$chain, since the sequence $x_1 = x, x_2 = (6,2,1), x_3 = y$ is such that $d(x_1, x_2) = 5$ and $d(x_2, x_3) = 8$. In fact, $N = 8$ is the least $N$ so that for any two factorizations of $s = 70$ there is an $8-$chain. It is said that $N = 8$ is the [catenary degree](Catenary-degree-of-an-element.qmd) of $s = 70$ in $S$.

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to $N-$chain of factorizations.

## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd). It is defined the Delta set of $S$, denoted by $\Delta(S)$, as

$$
\Delta(S) = \bigcup_{s \in S} \Delta(s),
$$

where $\Delta(s)$ denotes the [delta set of s](Delta-set-of-an-element.qmd) in $S$. If $Betti(S)$ is the set of [Betti elements](../Presentations-NS/Betti-element.qmd) of $S$, it can be proven that

$$
\max \Delta(S) = \max \{\max \Delta(b) ~ | ~ b \in Betti(S)\}.
$$

Given a numerical semigroup $S$, there is a relation between its Delta set $\Delta(S)$, its [catenary degree](Catenary-degree-of-a-numerical-semigroup.qmd) $\mathbf{C}(S)$, its [w-primality](w-primality-of-a-numerical-semigroup.qmd) $\omega(S)$ and its [tame degree](Tame-degree-of-a-numerical-semigroup.qmd) $\mathbf{t}(S)$, which is

$$
\max \Delta(S) + 2 \le \mathbf{C}(S) \le \omega(S) \le \mathbf{t}(S).
$$

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 2, 3 \rangle$. If $\nabla_s$ is not connected, where $\nabla_s$ denotes the [graph associated to s](../Presentations-NS/Graph-associated-to-an-element.qmd), then $s = n + w$ with $n \in \{2,3\}$ and $w \in Ap(S,2)$. From the above argument, it is deduced that $Betti(S) = \{6\}$, and its [set of factorizations](../Presentations-NS/Set-of-factorizations.qmd) is $\mathbf{Z}(6) = \{(3,0),(0,2)\}$. Thus, $\Delta(6) = \{1\}$ and $\max \Delta(S) = \{1\}$, consequently, $\Delta(S) = \{1\}$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 13, 45, 60, 89 \rangle$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(13, 45, 60, 89);
<Numerical semigroup with 4 generators>
```

Given a numerical semigroup $S$, the function `DeltaSet` return the Delta set of $S$. If we also give an element $n \in S$, the function returns the Delta set of $n$ in $S$.

``` gap
gap> DeltaSet(S);
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11 ]
gap> DeltaSet(S, 314);
[ 1, 2, 4 ]
```

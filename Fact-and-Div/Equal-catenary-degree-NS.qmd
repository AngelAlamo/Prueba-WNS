## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd). It is defined the equal catenary degree of $S$, denoted by $EqC(S)$, as

$$
EqC(S) = \max_{s \in S} EqC(s),
$$

where $EqC(s)$ denotes the [equal catenary degree](Equal-catenary-degree-element.qmd) of $s$ in $S$. 

It can be proven that $EqC(S) = \max_{s \in I} EqC(S)$, where $I$ is the set of [primitive elements](../Basic-concepts/Primitive-element.qmd) of $S$.


## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle \rangle$.


## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 3, 8, 10 \rangle$, in GAP:

```gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(3, 8, 10);
<Numerical semigroup with 3 generators>
```

Given a numerical semigroup $S$, the function `EqualCatenaryDegreeOfNumericalSemigroup` returns the equal catenary degree of $S$.

```gap
gap> EqualCatenaryDegreeOfNumericalSemigroup(S);
7
```

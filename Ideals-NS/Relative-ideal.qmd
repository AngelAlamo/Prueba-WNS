## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](./Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd). A subset $E$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ is a relative ideal of $S$ if $S + E = \{s + e ~ | ~ s \in S, e \in E \} \subseteq E$ and there exists $s \in S$ such that $s + E = \{s + e ~ | ~ e \in E \}\subseteq S$.

Two relative ideals $E$ and $H$ are said to be equivalent if there exists $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $E = x + H = \{x + h ~ | ~ h \in H \}$. As a consequence, every relative ideal is equivalent to some [proper ideal](Proper-ideal.qmd).

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 3, 8, 10 \rangle = \{0, 3, 6, 8, \rightarrow \}$ and $E = \langle 3 \rangle$ the ideal generated by $A = \{3\}$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. $E$ is not a relative ideal since $S + E \subsetneq E$, note that $3 + 8 = 11 \not \in E$ but $3 \in E$ and $8 \in S$.

$\circ$ Let $S$ a numerical semigroup, $k \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ and $I = \{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k\}$ a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ arbitrary but fixed. Then, the set $E = I + S$ is a relative ideal of $S$. The first condition is obvious, and if we take $w = \max I$, defining $s = C(S) + w$, where $C(S)$ denotes the [conductor](./Basic-concepts/Conductor.qmd) of $S$, we have that $s + E \subseteq S$. In conclusion $E$ is a relative ideal.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S$ a numerical semigroup and $I$ a list of integers. As we know, the subset $E = I + S$ is a relative ideal of $S$, the function `IdealOfNumericalSemigroup` returns the ideal generated by $I$ and $S$.

```{GAP}
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(12,17,20);

<Numerical semigroup with 3 generators>

gap> I := [-5, -4, 13];

[ -5, -4, 13 ]

gap> IS := IdealOfNumericalSemigroup(I,S);

<Ideal of numerical semigroup>


```

It is also possible to generate it with the + operator.

```{GAP}
gap> J := I + S;

<Ideal of numerical semigroup>

gap> J = IS;

true

```

In the case where we have an ideal $I$, the function `IsIdealOfNumericalSemigroup` check whether is an relative ideal of a numerical semigroup or not.

```{GAP}
gap> T := [1..5] + NumericalSemigroup(3,8);

<Ideal of numerical semigroup>

gap> IsIdealOfNumericalSemigroup(T);

true

```

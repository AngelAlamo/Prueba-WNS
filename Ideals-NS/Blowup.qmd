## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) and let $E$ be a [proper ideal](Proper-ideal.qmd) of $S$ with [multiplicity ideal](Multiplicity-ideal.qmd) $m(E)$ and [reduction number](Reduction-number.qmd) $r(E)$. It is defined the blowup of $E$ as the proper ideal $r(E)E - r(E)m(E)$. It is denoted by $\mathcal{B}(E)$.

It can be proven that $r(E)E - r(E)m(E) = r(E)E - r(E)E$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 3, 5, 7 \rangle$, $I = \{2, 4\}$ and $E = I + S = \{2, 4, 5, 7, \rightarrow \}$. Clearly, $m(E) = 2$, then we are looking for the smaller $h \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ such that $(h+1)E = 2 + hE$. If we take $h = 1$,

$$
2E = E + E = \{4, 6, \rightarrow\} \ne \{4, 6, 7, 9, \rightarrow \} = 2 + E.
$$

For $h = 2$,

$$
3E = (E + E) + E = \{6, 8, \rightarrow\} = 2 + 2E
$$

To sum up, $r(E) = 2$ and the blowup of $E$ is $2E - 2E = \{0, 2, \rightarrow \}$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 16, 21, 30, 47 \rangle$, $I = \{37, 51, 102\}$ and $K = I + S$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(16, 21, 30, 47);
<Numerical semigroup with 4 generators>
gap> I := [37, 51, 102];
[ 37, 51, 102 ]
gap> K := I + S;
<Ideal of numerical semigroup>
```

The function `BlowUp` returns the blowup of a proper ideal.

``` gap
gap> L := BlowUp(K);
<Ideal of numerical semigroup>
```

Let's check it. The function `ReductionNumber` returns the reduction number of the proper ideal.

```         
gap> r := ReductionNumber(K);
2
gap> L = r*K - r*K;
true
```

## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) and let $E$ be a [proper ideal](Proper-ideal.qmd) of $S$. It is said that $E$ is integrally closed if it is of the form $S(s) = (s + \mathbb{N}) \cap S$ for some $s \in S$.

It can be proven that $E$ is integrally closed if, and only if, $E = S(m(E))$, where $m(E)$ denotes the [multiplicity ideal](Multiplicity-ideal.qmd) of $E$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S$ a numerical semigroup, then the [maximal ideal](Maximal-ideal.qmd) $M = S^*$ is integrally closed, since $S^* = (m(S) + \mathbb{N}) \cap S$, where $m(S)$ denotes the [multiplicity](../Basic-concepts/Multiplicity.qmd) of $S$.

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 5, 7, 9 \rangle = \{0, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, \rightarrow \}$, $I = \{9, 10, 12, 14\}$ and $E = I + S$, lets prove the equality $E = (9 + \mathbb{N}) \cap S$. First, $(9 + \mathbb{N}) \cap S = \{9, 10, 12, 14, \rightarrow\}$, then we have to prove that $E = \{9, 10, 12, 14, \rightarrow\}$.

-   Let $e \in E$, then exist $i \in I$ and $s \in S$ such that $e = i + s$. If $s = 0$, $e \in I \subseteq \{9, 10, 12, 14, \rightarrow\}$, otherwise, $e = i + s \ge i + 5 \ge 14$ and $e \in \{9, 10, 12, 14, \rightarrow\}$.

-   It is easy to check that $\{14, 15, 16, 17, 18\} \subseteq E$, then for all $n \ge 14$ it holds $n \in E$ and $\{9, 10, 12, 14, \rightarrow\} \subseteq E$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 13, 15, 29, 31 \rangle$, $I = \{72, 75, 77\}$ and $K = I + S$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(13, 15, 29, 31);
<Numerical semigroup with 4 generators>
gap> I := [72, 75, 77];
[ 72, 75, 77 ]
gap> K := I + S;
<Ideal of numerical semigroup>
```

Nowadays, there is no direct function that determines whether a proper ideal is integrally closed or not, but it is easy to compute it. First, the function `Minimum` returns the multiplicity of a proper ideal; afterwards, the function `NumericalSemigroupBySmallElements` generates the numerical semigroup given a list with the [left elements](../Basic-concepts/Left-elements.qmd) of $S$ and the [conductor](../Basic-concepts/Conductor.qmd) of $S$; also, the function `Intersection` computes the intersection of numerical semigroups; next, the function `MaximalIdeal` returns the maximal ideal of the numerical semigroup; finally, the function `SmallElements` returns the set formed by the left elements and the conductor. Taking into account that $E$ is integrally closed if, and only if, $E = S(m(E))$, we have the result.

``` gap
gap> m := Minimum(K);
72
gap> N1 := NumericalSemigroupBySmallElements([0, m]);
<Numerical semigroup>
gap> SmallElements(K) = SmallElements(MaximalIdeal(Intersection(N1, S)));
false
```

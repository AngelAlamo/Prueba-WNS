## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) and let $E$ be a [relative ideal](Relative-ideal.qmd) of $S$. It is defined the multiplicity of $E$ as the minimum of $E$.

It can be proven that every relative ideal of a semigroup has a minimum. This property is due to the second condition of relative ideal of a numerical semigroup.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $E = \{-2, -1\} + S$. Clearly, $S + E \subseteq S$ and if we take $s = C(S) + 2$, where $C(S)$ is the [conductor](../Basic-concepts/Conductor.qmd) of $S$ then $s + E \subseteq S$. Therefore, $E$ is a relative ideal of $S$ and $m(E) = -2$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $I = \{8, 9, \ldots, 15\}$ and $S = \langle 6, 10, 15 \rangle$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> I := [8..15];
[ 8 .. 15 ]
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(6,8,15);
<Numerical semigroup with 3 generators>
```

In order to obtain the multiplicity of the relative ideal $E = I + S$, we can use the function `Minimum`.

``` gap
gap> Minimum(I+S);
8
```

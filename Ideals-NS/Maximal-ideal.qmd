## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](./Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd). It is defined the maximal ideal of $S$ as the subset $S^*$, and is usually denoted by $M(S)$. This definition is motivated by the definitions of [relative ideal](Relative-ideal.qmd) of $S$ and [proper ideal](Proper-ideal.qmd) of $S$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S$ a numerical semigroup and $E$ a proper ideal of $S$. If $0 \in E$, then $S \subset S + E$, but if $E$ is an ideal of $S$, $S + E \subset E$ and $E = S$. Therefore, every ideal of $S$ is a subset of $S^*$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 13, 15, 20 \rangle$, in GAP:

```{GAP}
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(13, 15, 20);

<Numerical semigroup with 3 generators>

```

There are two ways to compute the maximal ideal of a numerical semigroup, these are with the functions `MaximalIdeal` and `MaximalIdealOfNumericalSemigroup`.

```{GAP}
gap> I := MaximalIdeal(S);

<Ideal of numerical semigroup>

gap> J := MaximalIdealOfNumericalSemigroup(S);

<Ideal of numerical semigroup>

gap> I = J;

true

```

## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) and let $E$ be a [relative ideal](Relative-ideal.qmd) of $S$. It is defined the genus of $E$ as $g(E) = |(m(E) + \mathbb{N}) \setminus E|$, where $m(E)$ denotes the [multiplicity](Multiplicity-ideal.qmd) of $E$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 5, 7, 9 \rangle = \{0, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, \rightarrow \}$ and $E = \{-14\} + S = \{-14, -9, -7, -5, -4, -2, 0, \rightarrow\}$. Clearly, $m(E) = -14$, so $g(E) = |(-14 + \mathbb{N}) \setminus E| = |\{-13, -12, -11, -10, -8, -6, -3, -1\}| = 8$.

$\circ$ The definition of genus of a relative ideal is a generalization of the definition of [genus](../Basic-concepts/Genus.qmd) of a numerical semigroup. Indeed, let $S$ be a numerical semigroup with genus $g$. In particular, $S$ is a relative ideal of itself, then $g(S) = |(m(S) + \mathbb{N}) \setminus S|$. The multiplicity of $S$ (as relative ideal) is $m(S) = 0$, therefore $g(S) = |\mathbb{N} \setminus S| = g$.

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to genus of a relative ideal.

## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](./Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) and $H,E$ two [proper ideals](Proper-ideal.qmd) of $S$ with $H \subseteq E$. We say that $H$ is a reduction of $E$ if, for some $h \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, the equality $(h+1)E = H + hE$ holds.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S$ a numerical semigroup and $E$ a proper ideal of $S$ with [multiplicity](Multiplicity-ideal.qmd) $m(E)$. If we consider the following chain of relative ideals,

$$
S \subseteq E - m(E) \subseteq 2E - 2m(E) \subseteq \cdots \subseteq jE - jm(E) \subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathbb{N},
$$ it eventually stabilizes, since $|\mathbb{N} \setminus S|$ is finite. Then, exists $h \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ such that $hE - hm(E) = (h+1)E - (h+1)m(E)$, or equivalently, $(h+1)E = hE + m(E) = [m(E) + S] + hE$, that means, $m(E) + S$ is a reduction of $E$.

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to reduction of ideals.

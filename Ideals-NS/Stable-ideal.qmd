## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) and let $E$ be a [proper ideal](Proper-ideal.qmd) of $S$ with [reduction number](Reduction-number.qmd) $r(E)$. It is said that $E$ is stable if $r(E) = 1$, that is, $2E = m(E) + E$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 3, 5, 7 \rangle$, $I = \{2, 4\}$ and $E = I + S = \{2, 4, 5, 7, \rightarrow \}$. Clearly, $m(E) = 2$, then we are looking for the smaller $h \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ such that $(h+1)E = 2 + hE$. If we take $h = 1$,

$$
2E = E + E = \{4, 6, \rightarrow\} \ne \{4, 6, 7, 9, \rightarrow \} = 2 + E.
$$

Therefore, $E$ is not stable. It is easy to prove that $r(E) = 2$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 12, 15, 19, 20 \rangle$, $I = \{24, 38, 40\}$ and $K = I + S$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(12, 15, 19, 20);
<Numerical semigroup with 4 generators>
gap> I := [24, 38, 40];
[ 24, 38, 40 ]
gap> K := I + S;
<Ideal of numerical semigroup>
```

There is no direct method that states if a proper ideal is stable or not, but the function `Reduction number` returns the reduction number of a proper ideal.

``` gap
gap> ReductionNumber(K);
1
```

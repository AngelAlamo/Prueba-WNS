## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](./Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd). It is defined the conductor ideal of $S$ as the set $S - \mathbb{N} = \{z \in \mathbb{Z} ~ | ~ z + \mathbb{N} \subseteq S \}$. Equivalently, the conductor ideal of $S$ is defined as the numerical semigroup $S - \mathbb{N} = \{C(S), \rightarrow \}$, where $C(S)$ denotes the [conductor](./Basic-concepts/Conductor.qmd) of $S$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 5, 8, 11 \rangle$. Computing the first elements of $S$, it is obtained that $S = \{0, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, \rightarrow \}$, thus $C(S) = 18$ and $S - \mathbb{N} = \{18, \rightarrow \}$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 13, 15, 20 \rangle$, $I = \{8, 9, \ldots, 15\}$ and $K = I + S$, in GAP:

```{GAP}
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(13, 15, 20);

<Numerical semigroup with 3 generators>

gap> I := [8..15];

[ 8 .. 15 ]

gap> K := I + S;

<Ideal of numerical semigroup>


```

There are two ways to compute the conductor of a numerical semigroup from the relative ideal, these are with the functions `Conductor` and `ConductorOfIdealOfNumericalSemigroup`.

```{GAP}

gap> Conductor(K);

21

gap> ConductorOfNumericalSemigroup(K);

21

```

Therefore the conductor ideal of $K = I + S$ is $K - \mathbb{N} = \{21, \rightarrow\}$.

## Definition

Let $\mathbb{Q}_0^+$ denote the set of non-negative rational numbers and let $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_0^+$ be a map. It is said that $f$ is a subadditive function if

1.  $f(0) = 0$,

2.  $f(x + y) \le f(x) + f(y)$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{N}$.

Given a subadditive function $f$, the set

$$
M(f) = \{x \in \mathbb{N} ~ | ~ f(x) \le x\},
$$

is a submonoid of $\mathbb{N}$. Moreover, if $f$ has [period](Period-of-a-subadditive-function.qmd) $m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, it can be proven that $M(f)$ is a numerical semigroup.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_0^+$ such that $f(0) = 0$ and for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $f(n) = 2n + 1$. Given $x, y \in \mathbb{N}$,

$$
f(x + y) = 2(x + y) + 1 = 2x + 2y + 1 < (2x + 1) + (2y + 1) = f(x) + f(y).
$$

In conclusion, $f$ is a subadditive function.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $f$ be a periodic subadditive function with period $m$. Given a list of images of the integers from $1$ to $m$, the function `NumericalSemigroupBySubAdditiveFunction` returns the numerical semigroup $M(f)$ if it is possible (that means, if the list generates a subadditive function). The image of $m$ has to be $0$.

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroupBySubAdditiveFunction([6, 5, 3, 0]);
<Numerical semigroup>
```

$S$ is the numerical semigroup of the subadditive function $f$ such that $f(0) = 0, f(1) = 6, f(2) = 5, f(3) = 3$ and period $m = 4$. The function `SmallElements` returns a list with the [left elements](../Basic-concepts/Left-elements.qmd) and the [conductor](../Basic-concepts/Conductor.qmd) of the numerical semigroup.

``` gap
gap> SmallElements(S);
[ 0, 3, 4, 6 ]
```

To sum up, the numerical semigroup generated by $f$ is $S = M(f) = \{0, 3, 4, 6, \rightarrow\}$.

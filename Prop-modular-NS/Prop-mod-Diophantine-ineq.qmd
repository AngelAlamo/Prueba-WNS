## Definition

Let $a,b$ and $c$ positive integers. It is said that an expression is a proportionally modular Diophantine inequality if it is of the form $ax ~ (mod ~ b) \le cx$. The integers $a,b$ and $c$ are called the [factor](Factor-prop-mod-Diophantine-ineq.qmd), [modulus](Modulus-prop-mod-Diophantine-ineq.qmd) and [proportion](Proportion-prop-mod-Diophantine-ineq.qmd), respectively.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $a = 4, b = 13$ and $c = 2$ and define the proportionally modular Diophantine inequality $4x ~ (mod ~ 13) \le 2x$. If $x \le 3$ and $x \ne 0$,

$$
4x ~ (mod ~ 13) = 4x > 2x.
$$

On the other hand, if $x \ge 6$,

$$
4x ~ (mod ~ 13) \le 12 \le 2x.
$$ Furthermore, $x = 4$ and $x = 5$ are also solutions. Therefore, the set of solutions is $S(a,b,c) = \{0, 4, \rightarrow\}$. It can be proven that the set of solutions of a proportionally modular Diophantine inequality is always a numerical semigroup, it is called a [proportionally modular](../Families-NS/NS-prop-modular.qmd) numerical semigroup.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $a, b$ positive integers. The function `ModularNumericalSemigroup` returns the numerical semigroup generated by the [modular Diophantine inequality](Modular-Diophantine-ineq.qmd) $ax ~ (mod ~ b) \le x$. The numerical semigroups that are the set of solutions of a modular Diophantine inequality are called [modular numerical semigroups](../Families-NS/NS-modular.qmd).

``` gap
gap> a := 6;
6
gap> b := 19;
19
gap> S := ModularNumericalSemigroup(a,b);
<Modular numerical semigroup satisfying 6x mod 19 <= x >
```

The function `SmallElements` returns a list with the [left elements](../Basic-concepts/Left-elements.qmd) and the [conductor](../Basic-concepts/Conductor.qmd) of the numerical semigroup.

``` gap
gap> SmallElements(S);
[ 0, 7, 10, 11, 13 ]
```

Then, the set of solutions of $6x ~ (mod ~ 19) \le x$ is $S = \{0, 7, 10, 11, 13, \rightarrow \}$.

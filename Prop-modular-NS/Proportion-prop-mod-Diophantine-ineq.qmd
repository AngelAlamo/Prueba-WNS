## Definition

Let $a, b$ and $c$ positive integers and let $ax ~ (mod ~ b) \le cx$ be a [proportionally modular Diophantine inequality](Prop-mod-Diophantine-ineq.qmd). It is defined the proportion of a proportionally modular Diophantine inequality as the integer $c$. The integer $a$ is called the [factor](Factor-prop-mod-Diophantine-ineq.qmd) and $b$ the [modulus](Modulus-prop-mod-Diophantine-ineq.qmd) of a proportionally modular Diophantine inequality.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $14x ~ (mod ~ 52) \le 7x$. Then, the factor of the proportionally modular Diophantine inequality is $a = 14$, the modulus is $b = 52$ and the proportion is $c = 7$.

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to proportion of a proportionally modular Diophantine inequality.

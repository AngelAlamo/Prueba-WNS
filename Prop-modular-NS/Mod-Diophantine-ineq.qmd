## Definition

Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. It is said that an expression is a modular Diophantine inequality if it is of the form $ax ~ (mod ~ b) \le x$. The integers $a,b$ are called the [factor](Factor-prop-mod-Diophantine-ineq.qmd) and [modulus](Modulus-prop-mod-Diophantine-ineq.qmd) respectively. An expression of the form $ax ~ (mod ~ b) \le cx$ for some $a,b,c$ positive integers, are called [proportionally modular Diophantine inequality](Prop-mod-Diophantine-ineq.qmd).

It can be proven that the set of solutions,

$$
S(a,b,c) = \{ x \in \mathbb{N} ~ | ~ ax ~ (mod ~ b) \le cx\},
$$

is a numerical semigroup. If $S$ is a numerical semigroup such that $S = S(a,b,c)$ for some $a,b,c$ positive integers with $c \ne 1$, it is said that $S$ is [proportionally modular](../Families-NS/NS-prop-modular.qmd), and if $c = 1$, then it is said that $S$ is [modular](../Families-NS/NS-modular.qmd).

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $a = 3, b = 8$ and define the modular Diophantine inequality $3x ~ (mod ~ 8) \le x$. For $x \in \{1, 2\}$,

$$
3x ~ (mod ~ 9) = 3x > x.
$$

On the other hand, if $x \ge 8$,

$$
3x ~ (mod ~ 9) \le 8 \le x.
$$

Moreover, $x \in S(3,8,1)$ for all $x \in \{0, 3, 4, 6, 7\}$ and for $x = 5$ the inequality does not hold. Therefore, the set of solutions is $S(a,b,c) = \{0, 3, 4, 6, \rightarrow\}$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $a, b$ positive integers. The function `ModularNumericalSemigroup` returns the numerical semigroup generated by the modular Diophantine inequality $ax ~ (mod ~ b) \le x$.

``` gap
gap> a := 6;
6
gap> b := 19;
19
gap> S := ModularNumericalSemigroup(a,b);
<Modular numerical semigroup satisfying 6x mod 19 <= x >
```

The function `SmallElements` returns a list with the [left elements](../Basic-concepts/Left-elements.qmd) and the [conductor](../Basic-concepts/Conductor.qmd) of the numerical semigroup.

``` gap
gap> SmallElements(S);
[ 0, 7, 10, 11, 13 ]
```

Then, the set of solutions of $6x ~ (mod ~ 19) \le x$ is $S = \{0, 7, 10, 11, 13, \rightarrow \}$.

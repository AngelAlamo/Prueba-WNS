## Definition

Let $f(x,y) = y^n + a_1(x)y^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n(x) \in \mathbb{K}((x))[y]$ be an irreducible polynomial, and let $x(t), y(t)$ a [short parametrization](Short-parametrization.qmd) of $f$. Let $\mathbf{A} = \mathbb{K}[[x(t), y(t)]]$ and let $\mathbf{M} = x'(t) \mathbf{A} + y'(t) \mathbf{A}$. It is defined

$$
I = \{ord_t(g) ~ | ~ g \in \mathbf{M} \}.
$$
It can be proven that $I$ is a [relative ideal](../Ideals-NS/Relative-ideal.qmd) of $S = \Gamma(f)$, the [numerical semigroup associated to f](Polynomial-NS.qmd). It is said that $i \in I$ is an exact degree if $i+1 \in S$. The other elements are said non exact degrees of $\mathbf{M}$. The set of non exact degrees is denoted by $NE(M)$.


## Examples

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays there is no function in the package NumericalSgps related to exact degree of algebroid curves.

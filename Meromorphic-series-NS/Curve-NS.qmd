## Definition

The definition of numerical semigroup associated to a curve needs the following proposition.

## Proposition

Let $F = y^n + a_1(x)y^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n(x)$ be a nonzero polynomial of $\mathbb{K}[x][y]$ and assume, possibly after a change of variables, that $deg_x ~ a_i(x) < i$ for all $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ such that $a_i(x) \ne 0$. Let $h_F(u,x,y) = u^n F \left( \frac{x}{u}, \frac{y}{v} \right)$, $F_{\infty}(u,y) = h_F(u,1,y)$ and $f(x,y) = F(x^{-1}, y) \in \mathbb{K}[x^{-1}, y]$.

1.  $f(x,y) = x^{-n}F_{\infty}(x, y)$.

2.  $F$ has [one place at infinity](Curves-one-place-infinity.qmd) if, and only if, $f(x,y)$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{K}((x))[y]$.
:::

Let us consider the hypothesis of the proposition and also that $F$ has one place at the point at infinity. It is defined the numerical semigroup associated to $f$ as

$$
\Gamma(f) = \{int(f,g) ~ | ~ g \in \mathbb{K}[x^{-1}][y] \setminus (f)\}.
$$

It can be proven that $\Gamma(f)$ is a subsemigroup of $- \mathbb{N}$.

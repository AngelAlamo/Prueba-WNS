## Definition

The definition of very short parametrization comes from the following result.

## Proposition

Let $f(x,y) = y^n + a_1(x)y^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n(x) \in \mathbb{K}[[x]][y]$ be an irreducible polynomial, $S = \Gamma(f) = \langle r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_h \rangle$ the [numerical semigroup associated to f](Polynomial-NS.qmd) with $r_0 = n, r_1 = m$ and let $G(S)$ be the set of [gaps](../Basic-concepts/Gap.qmd). Then, modulo an automorphism of $\mathbb{K}[[x,y]]$, $f$ has a parametrization of the form $x = t^n$ and $y = t^m + \sum_{q \in G(S), q > m} c_q t^q$, such that if $y - t^m \ne 0$ and $\lambda = \inf( Supp(y - t^m))$, where $Supp(y-t^m)$ denotes the [support](Support.qmd) of $y$ and $t^m$, then $n + \lambda \not \in S$.
:::

Let us consider the hypothesis of the proposition. It is said that a parametrization of $f$ is a very short parametrization of $f$ if it has an expression as above and satisfies the condition mentioned.

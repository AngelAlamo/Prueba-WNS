## Definition

The definition of Newton-Puiseux exponents comes from the following result.

$\textbf{Preposition}$: Let $f(x,y) = y^n + a_1(x)y^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n(x) \in \mathbb{K}((x))[y]$. Suppose that $f(x,y)$ is irreducible. There exists $y(t) \in \mathbb{K}((t))$ such that $f(t^n, y(t)) = 0$. Furthermore,

(i) $f(t^n, y) = \prod_{w, w^n = 1} (y - y(wt))$,

(ii) if $w_1 \ne w_2$ and $w_1^n = w_2^n = 1$, then $y(w_1t) \ne y(w_2t)$,

(iii) $gcd(n, gcd(Supp(y(t)))) = 1$,

where $Supp(y(t))$ is the [support](Support.qmd) of $y(t)$.

Let us consider $f(x,y) \in \mathbb{K}((x))[y]$ irreducible and let $y = \sum_{p \in \mathbb{N}} c_p t^p \in \mathbb{K}((t))$.

-   Let $d_1 = n = deg_y(f)$ and let $m_1 = \min \{p \in Supp(y(t)) ~ | ~ d_1 \not | \ \ p\}$, $d_2 = gcd(d_1, m_1)$. Then for all $i \ge 2$, if $d_i \ne 1$, let $m_i = \min \{p \in Supp(y(t)) ~ | ~ d_i \not | \ \ p \}$ and $d_{i+1} = gcd(d_i, m_i)$. By the above preposition, $m_i$ is well defined and there exists $h \ge 1$ such that $d_{h+1} = 1$. It is defined the Newton-Poiseux exponents of $f$ as $(m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_h)$ and is denoted by $\underline{m}$.

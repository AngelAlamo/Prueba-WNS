## Definition

Let $f(x,y) = y^n + a_1(x)y^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n(x) \in \mathbb{K}((x))[y]$ be an irreducible polynomial. It is defined the numerical semigroup associated to a polynomial as

$$
\Gamma(f) = \{int(f,g) ~ | ~ g \in \mathbb{K}((x))[y] \setminus (f) \},
$$

where $int(f,g)$ denotes the [intersection multiplicity](Intersection-multiplicity.qmd) of $f$ with $g$.

It can be proven that for any polynomial $f$ monic and irreducible in $\mathbb{K}((x))[y]$, $\Gamma(f)$ is a [free](../Families-NS/NS-free.qmd) [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) generated by $\underline{r} = (r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_h)$, where $\underline{r}$ comes from the definition of [characteristic sequences](Characteristic-sequences.qmd) of $f$.

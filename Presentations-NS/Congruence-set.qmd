## Definition

Let us consider $p \in \mathbb{N}$ arbitrary but fixed. Given $\tau \in \mathbb{N}^p \times \mathbb{N}^p$, the congruence generated by $\tau$ is the smallest congruence on $\mathbb{N}^p$ containing $\tau$, and it is denoted by $cong(\tau)$.

It is said that a congruence $\tau$ is generated by a set if there exists $\rho \in \mathbb{N}^p \times \mathbb{N}^p$ such that $\tau = Cong(\rho)$. If there exists a system of generators of $\tau$ with finitely many elements, it is said that $\tau$ is finitely generated, and if $\rho$ has the least cardinality possible among the cardinals of system of generators of $\tau$, it is said that $\rho$ is a minimal relation.

It is said that an element $(a,b) \in \tau \setminus \{(0,0)\}$ is irreducible if it cannot be expressed as $(a,b) = (a_1, b_1) + (a_2, b_2)$ for some $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2) \in \tau \setminus \{(0,0)\}$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to congruence generated by a set.

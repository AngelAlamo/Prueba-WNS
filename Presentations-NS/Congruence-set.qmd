## Definition

Let us consider $p \in \mathbb{N}$ arbitrary but fixed. Given $\tau \in \mathbb{N}^p \times \mathbb{N}^p$, the congruence generated by $\tau$ is the smallest congruence on $\mathbb{N}^p$ containing $\tau$, and it is denoted by $cong(\tau)$.

It can be proven that $cong(\tau)$ is the intersection of all congruences containing it.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $\tau = \{(7, 14), (20, 22), (39, 7), (20, 13), (7, 7)\} \subseteq \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$. For $\tau$ to be an equivalence relation, we define the sets $A_1, A_2$ and $A_3$ as

$$
A_1 = \{(7,7), (13, 13), (14,14), (20,20), (22,22), (39,39) \},
$$

$$
A_2 = \{(14, 7), (22,20), (7, 39), (13, 20)\},
$$

$$
A_3 = \{(39, 14), (14, 39), (22,13), (13,22)\}.
$$

It is easy to prove that $\tau' = \tau \cup \left( \bigcup_{i = 1}^3 A_i \right)$ is an equivalence. Now, $\tau'$ will be a congruence if for all pairs $(a,b) \in \tau_3$ and for all $u \in \mathbb{N}$, it holds $(a + u, b + u) \in \tau'$, then we have to add the set

$$
B = \{(a + u, b + u) ~ | ~ (a, b) \in \tau', u \in \mathbb{N} \}.
$$

Finally, the congruence of $\tau$ is $cong(\tau) = \tau' \cup B$.

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays there is no function in the package NumericalSgps related to congruence generated by a set.

## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd), let $\phi$ be the [factorization homomorphism](Factorization-homomorphism.qmd) of $S$ and let $\ker(\phi)$ be the kernel of $\phi$ as a [congruence](Congruence-set.qmd). A set $B \subseteq \ker(\phi)$ is a presentation of $S$ if $B$ is a generator system of $\ker(\phi)$, that is, if $\ker(\phi) = Cong(B)$ where $Cong(B)$ denotes the [congruence generated by the set B](Congruence-set.qmd). It is said that $B$ is a minimal presentation if no proper subsets of $B$ is a presentation.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let us consider $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ with $gcd(a,b) = 1$ and $S = \langle a, b \rangle$. Let us prove that $\{[(b,0), (0,a)]\}$ is a minimal presentation of $S$. Given $[(\alpha_1, \beta_1), (\alpha_2, \beta_2)] \in \ker(\phi)$, and with loss of generality let us suppose $\alpha_1 > \alpha_2$, we have

$$
\alpha_1a + \beta_1b = \phi(\alpha_1, \beta_1) = \phi(\alpha_2, \beta_2) = \alpha_2a + \beta_2 b
$$

$$
\Longleftrightarrow (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2)a = (\beta_2 - \beta_1)b.
$$

From this equality, it is deduced that exists $q \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 + bq$ and $\beta_2 = \beta_1 + aq$. Therefore,

$$
[(\alpha_1, \beta_1), (\alpha_2, \beta_2)] = [(\alpha_2, \beta_1), (\alpha_2, \beta_1)] + q[(b,0), (0,a)].
$$

Finally, is minimal since it only has one element.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 7, 15, 20 \rangle$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(7, 15, 20);
<Numerical semigroup with 3 generators>
```

In order to compute the minimal presentation of $S$, the function `MinimalPresentation` returns a list with the minimal generators of the kernel of $\phi$.

``` gap
gap> MinimalPresentation(S);
[ [ [ 0, 0, 3 ], [ 0, 4, 0 ] ], [ [ 0, 1, 1 ], [ 5, 0, 0 ] ] ]
```

This minimal presentation says that $S$ is a monoid generated by three elements, $a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $3c = 4b$, $b + c = 5a$.

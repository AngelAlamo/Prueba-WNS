<!-- DefiniciÃ³n de Num. Sem. -->

## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) and let $C(S)$ be the [conductor](../Basic-concepts/Conductor.qmd) of $S$. It is said that $S$ is half-line, or ordinary, if $S= \{0, C(S), \rightarrow\}$. Equivalently, $S$ is half-line, or ordinary, if $s \ge C(S)$ for all $s \in S \setminus \{0\}$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S$ be a numerical semigroup. Let us prove that its [dominant](../Basic-concepts/Dominant.qmd) is $d(S) = 0$ if, and only if, $S$ is half-line.

$\Rightarrow$ If $d(S) = 0$, by definition,

$$
 d(S) = \max \{s \in S ~ | ~ s < C(S) \} = 0.
$$

Therefore, $S = \{0, C(S), \rightarrow \}$.

$\Leftarrow$ If $S = \{0, C(S), \rightarrow\}$, the only element $s \in S$ such that $s < C(S)$ is $s = 0$. Thus, $d(S) = 0$.

## Examples with GAP

The following examples are made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 5, 7, 9 \rangle$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(5, 7, 9);
<Numerical semigroup with 3 generators>
```

Given a numerical semigroup $S$, the function `IsOrdinary` returns true or false depending on whether a numerical semigroup is ordinary or not.

``` gap
gap> IsOrdinary(S);
false
```

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \rangle$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11);
<Numerical semigroup with 6 generators>
```

In this case,

``` gap
gap> IsOrdinary(S);
true
```

It is concluded that $S = \{0, 6, \rightarrow\}$.

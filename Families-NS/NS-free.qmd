## Definition

Let $S$ a [numerical semigroup](./Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) and $B = \{r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_h\}$ the [set of minimal generators](./Basic-concepts/Minimal-set-of-generators.qmd) of $S$. Let $d_1 = r_0$ and for all $k \in \{2, 3, \ldots, h+1\}$, set $d_k = gcd(d_{k-1}, r_{k-1})$ and define $e_k = \frac{d_k}{d_{k+1}}$. It is said that $S$ is free for the arrangement $(r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_h)$ if for all $k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, h\}$:

(i) $e_k > 1$.

(ii) $e_k r_k$ belongs to the semigroup generated by $\{r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_{k-1} \}$.

If $S$ is free for all arrangements of its minimal generators, then it is said that $S$ is universally free.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $a,b \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0, 1\}$ with $gcd(a,b) = 1$ and $S = \langle a,b \rangle$. Then, $h = 1$, $d_1 = a, d_2 = gcd(d_1, b) = 1$. We have, $e_1 = a > 1$ and $e_1 r_1 = a \in \langle a \rangle$. Therefore, any numerical semigroup with [embedding dimension](./Basic-concepts/Embedding-dimension.qmd) two is free.

## Examples with GAP

The following examples are made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 13, 40, 76 \rangle$, in GAP:

```{GAP}
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(13, 40, 76);

<Numerical semigroup with 3 generators>

```

In order to know if $S$ is free, we can use the function `IsFree`.

```{GAP}

gap> IsFree(S);

false
```

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 10, 15, 18 \rangle$, in GAP:

```{GAP}
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(10, 15, 18);

```

If we check whether $S$ is a free numerical semigroup, we obtain that:

```{GAP}

gap> IsFree(S);

true

```

The condition of free depends on the arrangement, the function `IsUniversallyFree` check if the numerical semigroup is free for all arrangements of its minimal generators.

```{GAP}
gap> IsUniversallyFree(S);

true

```

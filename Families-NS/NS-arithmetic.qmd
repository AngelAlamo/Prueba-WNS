## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd). It is said that $S$ is arithmetic if there exist $a, b$ integers with $0 \le b < a$ such that $S = \langle a, a+1, \ldots, a + b \rangle$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \{0, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, \rightarrow \}$, let us prove that $S$ is arithmetic. As $s = 6$ is the [multiplicity](../Basic-concepts/Multiplicity.qmd) of $S$, it has to be a [minimal generator](../Basic-concepts/Minimal-set-of-generators.qmd). On the other hand, $s = 7$ cannot be generated by $6$ and $s = 8$ cannot be generated by $6$ and $7$, then both are minimal generators. If we consider $B = \{6, 7, 8\}$, it is obtained that $B$ is a minimal set of generators of $S$. To sum up, $S = \langle 6, 7, 8 \rangle$ and is arithmetic with $a = 6$ and $b = 2$.

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to arithmetic numerical semigroups.

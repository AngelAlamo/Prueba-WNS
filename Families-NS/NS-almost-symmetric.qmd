## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](./Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd), $F(S)$ the [Frobenius number](./Basic-concepts/Frobenius-number.qmd), $g(S)$ the [genus](./Basic-concepts/Genus.qmd) and $t(S)$ the [type](./Basic-concepts/Type.qmd) of $S$. $S$ is almost a symmetric numerical semigroup if satisfies the equality $2g(S) = F(S) + t(S)$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 5, 7, 9 \rangle = \{0, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14\}$. It is easy to see that the set of gaps is $G(S) = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13\}$, the Frobenius number is $F(S) = 13$ and the set of [pseudo-Frobenius numbers](./Basic-concepts/Pseudo-Frobenius-number.qmd) is $PF(S) = \{11, 13\}$. Therefore, $g(S) = |G(S)| = 8, t(S) = |PF(S)| = 2$ and $2g(S) = 16 \ne 15 = 13 + 2 = F(S) + t(S)$, to sum up, $S$ is not an almost symmetric numerical semigroup.

$\circ$ Let $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ with $gcd(a,b) = 1$ and $S = \langle a, b \rangle$. It is well known that for numerical semigroups of [embedding dimension](./Basic-concepts/Embedding-dimension) two, $t(S) = 1$ and $2g(S) = F(S) + 1 = F(S) + t(S)$, therefore, every numerical semigroup with embedding dimension two is almost symmetric.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 5, 7, 9 \rangle$, in GAP:

```{GAP}
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(5, 7, 9);

```

We can check if $S$ is an almost symmetric numerical semigroup with the function `IsAlmostSymmetric`.

```{GAP}
gap> IsAlmostSymmetric(S);

false

```

If we are interested in how many almost symmetric numerical semigroups exist with a fixed Frobenius number $f$ and type $t$, the function `AlmostSymmetricNumericalSemigroupsWithFrobeniusNumberAndType` returns a list of all these almost symmetric numerical semigroups.

```{GAP}
gap> Length(AlmostSymmetricNumericalSemigroupsWithFrobeniusNumber(12));

15

```

There is an extension of the previous function, that is, `AlmostSymmetricNumericalSemigroupsWithFrobeniusNumber`, which returns all the almost symmetric numerical semigroups with fixed Frobenius number $f$ and type greater or equal to $t$.

```{GAP}
gap> Length(AlmostSymmetricNumericalSemigroupsWithFrobeniusNumberAndType(12,6));

4

```

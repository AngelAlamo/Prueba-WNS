## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](Numerical-semigroup.qmd) and let $G(S)$ be the set formed by the [gaps](Gap.qmd) of $S$. A gap $g \in G(S)$ is a fundamental gap of $S$ if $\{2g, 3g\} \subseteq S$, or equivalently, for every $n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0,1\}$, it holds that $ng \in S$. It is denoted by $FG(S)$ the set of fundamental gaps of $S$ and is always non-empty, due to $F(S) \in FG(S)$, where $F(S)$ is the [Frobenius number](Frobenius-number.qmd) of $S$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 4, 9, 10 \rangle = \{0, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, \rightarrow \}$. We have that $G(S) = \{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 15\}$ and checking the condition for each gap of $S$, it is concluded that $FG(S) = \{6, 7, 11, 15\}$.

$\circ$ Let us consider $b \in \mathbb{N}$ an odd element arbitrary but fixed. The set $S = \langle 2, b \rangle$ is a numerical semigroup (note that if $n \ge b$, then $n \in S$) and the gaps of $S$ are $G(S) = \{1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots, b - 2\}$, in other words, all the odd naturals smaller than $b$. Now, a gap $x \in G(S)$ is fundamental if $\{2x,3x\} \subseteq S$, in this case, as $2 \in S$, then $2x \in S$ for all $x \in G(S)$. On the other hand, $3x \in S$ if, and only if, $x \ge \lceil \frac{b}{3} \rceil$, therefore, $FG(S)$ consist in all the odd integers greater or equal to $\lceil \frac{b}{3} \rceil$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 4, 9, 10 \rangle$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(4, 9, 10);
<Numerical semigroup with 3 generators>
```

The function `FundamentalGaps` return all the fundamental gaps of $S$.

``` gap
gap> FundamentalGaps(S);
[ 6, 7, 11, 15 ]
```

If we want to know all the gaps of $S$, then we have the function `Gaps`.

``` gap
gap> Gaps(S);
[ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 15 ]
```

In this case, the fundamental gaps are the greatest of the set, but that does not hold for every numerical semigroup.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 5, 12, 18 \rangle$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(5, 12, 18);
<Numerical semigroup with 3 generators>
```

The gaps of $S$ are:

``` gap
gap> Gaps(S);
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 26, 31 ]
```

On the other hand, the fundamental gaps of $S$ are formed by:

``` gap
gap> FundamentalGaps(S);
[ 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, 19, 21, 26, 31 ]
```

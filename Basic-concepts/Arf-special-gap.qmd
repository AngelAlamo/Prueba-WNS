## Definition

Let $S$ be an [Arf](../Families-NS/Arf-semigroup.qmd) [numerical semigroup](Numerical-semigroup.qmd). It is defined the set of Arf special gaps of $S$, denoted by $ArfG(S)$, as

$$
ArfG(S) = \{x \in SG(S) ~ | ~ S \cup \{x\} ~~ \text{is an Arf numerical semigroup }\},
$$

where $SG(S)$ denotes the set of [special gaps](Special-gap.qmd) of $S$.

If $S = \{h_0 = 0, h_1, \ldots, h_{n-1}, h_n, \rightarrow\}$ is an Arf numerical semigroup and $x \in G(S)$ is such that $h_i < x < h_{i+1}$ for some $i \in \{0, \ldots, n-1\}$, it can be proven that $x \in ArfG(S)$ if, and only if, $x \in SG(S)$, $2x - h_i \in S$ and $2h_{i+1} - x \in S$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 3, 5, 7 \rangle = \{0, 3, 5, \rightarrow\}$. The set of [gaps](Gap.qmd) of $S$ is $G(S) = \{1, 2, 4\}$ and its set of special gaps is $SG(S) = \{x \in G(S) ~ | ~ \{2x, 3x\} \subseteq S\} = \{4\}$. We have that $3 < 4 < 5$, $4 \in SG(S)$, $2 \cdot 4 - 3 = 5 \in S$ and $2 \cdot 5 - 4 = 6 \in S$, concluding that $ArfSG(S) = \{4\}$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle P \rangle$ with

$$
P(S) = \{26, 29, 32, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 62\}.
$$

In GAP:

``` gap
gap> P := [26, 29, 32, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 62];
[ 26, 29, 32, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51,
  53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 62 ]
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(P);
<Numerical semigroup with 26 generators>
```

Given a numerical semigroup $S$, the function `ArfSpecialGaps` returns the set of Arf special gaps of $S$.

``` gap
gap> ArfSpecialGaps(S);
[ 13, 20, 23, 36 ]
```

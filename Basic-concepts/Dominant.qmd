## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](Numerical-semigroup.qmd) with positive [conductor](Conductor.qmd) $C(S)$. It is defined the dominant of $S$, denoted by $d(S)$, as $d(S) = \max \{s \in S ~ | ~ s < C(S)\}$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 3, 7, 11 \rangle$. We have that $9, 10, 11 \in S$ and $8 \not \in S$, therefore the conductor is $C(S) = 9$, and the dominant is $d(S) = 7$. This numerical semigroup is also [acute](../Families-NS/NS-Acute.qmd), since $C(S) - d(S) = 2$.

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to dominant of a numerical semigroup.

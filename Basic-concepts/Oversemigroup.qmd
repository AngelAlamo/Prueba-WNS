## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](Numerical-semigroup.qmd) arbitrary but fixed. It is said that $T$ is a oversemigroup of $S$ if $T$ is a numerical semigroup and $S \subseteq T$. The set of oversemigroups of $S$ is denoted by $\mathcal{O}(S)$.

The set $\mathcal{O}(S)$ is non-empty and finite for every numerical semigroup, since $S \in \mathcal{O}(S)$ and $|\mathbb{N} \setminus S|$ is finite.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 4, 5, 6 \rangle = \{ 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, \rightarrow\}$. The [gaps](Gap.qmd) of $S$ are $G(S) = \{1, 2, 3, 7\}$, so to compute the oversemigroups we have to add gaps to $S$ and check if it is in fact a numerical semigroup.

-   0 gaps: we have $S \subseteq S$ so $S$ is trivially a oversemigroup of $S$.

-   1 gap: the candidates are $T_{1,1} = S \cup \{1\}, T_{1,2} = S \cup \{2\}, T_{1,3} = S \cup \{3\}, T_{1,4} = S \cup \{7\}$ and $T_4$ is the only numerical semigroup.

-   2 gaps: in this case the oversemigroups are $T_{2,1} = S \cup \{2, 7\}, T_{2,2} = S \cup \{3, 7\}$.

-   3 gaps: the only oversemigroup is $T_{3,1} = S \cup \{2, 3, 7\}$.

-   4 gaps: we have the trivial oversemigroup $T_{4,1} = \mathbb{N}$.

To sum up, $\mathcal{O}(S) = \{S, S \cup \{7\}, S \cup \{2, 7\}, S \cup \{3, 7\}, S \cup \{2, 3, 7\}, \mathbb{N}\}$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 2, 5, 7 \rangle$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(2, 5, 7);
<Numerical semigroup with 3 generators>
```

To get the oversemigroups of $S$, the function `Oversemigroups` returns the set of oversemigroups.

``` gap
gap> OverSemigroups(S);
[ <The numerical semigroup N>, <Numerical semigroup with 2 generators>, <Numerical semigroup with 2 generators> ]
```

The code `List(List_NS, l -> Function(l));` return a list where it has applied `Function` to every element in $List\_NS$, for example, we can see the oversemigroups of $S$ by the set formed by its [left elements](Left-elements.qmd) and its [conductor](Conductor.qmd),

``` gap
gap> List(OverSemigroups(S), l -> SmallElements(l));
[ [ 0 ], [ 0, 2 ], [ 0, 2, 4 ] ]
```

or by its gaps,

``` gap
gap> List(OverSemigroups(S), l -> Gaps(l));
[ [  ], [ 1 ], [ 1, 3 ] ]
```

It is concluded that $\mathcal{O}(S) = \{S, T, \mathbb{N}\}$, where $T = \{0, 2, \rightarrow\}$.

## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](Numerical-semigroup.qmd). The definition of standard representation in a [free](../Families-NS/NS-free.qmd) numerical semigroup comes from the following result.

## Proposition

Assume that $S$ is free for the arrangement $(r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_h)$, and let $x \in \mathbb{Z}$. There exist unique $\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_h \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that the following holds.

1.  $\displaystyle x = \sum_{k = 0}^h \lambda_k r_k$.

2.  For all $k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, h\}$, $0 \le \lambda_k < e_k$.
:::

It is defined the standard representation of an integer $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ as the expression of $x$ which satisfies the conditions of the above proposition.

## Examples

$\circ$ Consider the free numerical semigroup $S = \langle 4, 6, 9 \rangle$ and the integer $x = 27$. The unique ways to generate $x$ from the set $B = \{4, 6, 7\}$ are with the coefficients $a_1 = (3, 1, 1), a_2 = (0, 3, 1)$ and $a_3 = (0, 0, 3)$. We have, $d_1 = r_0 = 4$, $d_2 = gcd(d_1, r_1) = gcd(4, 6) = 2$, $d_3 = gcd(d_2, r_2) = gcd(2, 9) = 1$, $e_1 = \frac{d_1}{d_2} = 2, e_2 = \frac{d_2}{d_3} = 2$. Checking the second condition on each $a_i$ with $i = 1,2,3$, it holds that the standard representation of $x = 27$ with respect to $S$ is $(3, 1, 1)$, since the representation is unique and satisfies the conditions.

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in NumericalSgps related to standard representations in a free numerical semigroup. However, given a list $I = \{r_0, \ldots, r_h\}$ such that $S = \langle I \rangle$ is free for the arrangement $(r_0, \ldots, r_h)$ and an integer $z \in \mathbb{Z}$, the following function returns a list with the coefficients of the standard representation of $z$ in $S$.



```gap
gap> StandardRepresentation := function(S, I, z)
>       local
>       
```

## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](Numerical-semigroup.qmd), let $p,q$ be two coprime in $S$ and $H_{p,q} = \langle p, q \rangle$. It holds that $H_{p,q}$ is a numerical semigroup and $H_{p,q} \subseteq S$, then every [gap](Gap.qmd) of $S$ is a gap of $H_{p,q}$. If $c$ is the [conductor](Conductor.qmd) of $H_{p,q}$, every gap $g$ of $H_{p,q}$ can be written uniquely as $g = c - 1 - (ap + bq)$, for some non-negative integers $a,b$. It is said that $(a,b)$ are the coordinates associated to $g$. Let $H(a,b)$ be the set of coordinates of the gaps of $H_{p,q}$. Then, it is defined the lattice path of $S$ with respect to $H_{p,q}$, denoted by $P_{p,q}$, as the path in $\mathbb{N}^2$,

$$
P_{p,q} = \{(a_1, b_1), \ldots, (a_n, b_n) \} \subseteq H(a,b),
$$

such that every element in $H(a,b)$ is below the lattice path.

From the definition, there is no gap in the line $px + qy = c-1$ and every point $(a,b) \in \mathbb{N}^2$ below the line is an element of $H(a,b)$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 \rangle = \{0, 5, 7, 9, \rightarrow\}$ and $p = 5, q = 7$. The set of gaps of $S$ is $G(S) = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8\}$. On the other hand, $H_{p,q} = \langle 5, 7 \rangle$ has conductor $C(H_{p,q})-1 = pq - p - q -1 = 23$, then $P = C(H_{p,q}) - 1 - G(S) = \{22, 21, 20, 19, 17, 15\}$ and its coordinates are $P' = \{(3,1), (0,3), (4,0), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0)\}$ ordered as in $P$. Considering the line $5x + 7y = 23$, we have the following situation.

![Lattice path of $S$ with respect to $H_{5,7}$.](../Images/Image_example1_lattice_path.png){width="300px" height="300px"}
:::

The red line is the line $5x + 7y = 23$ and the blue points are the coordinates of the gaps of $S$. As we can see in the image, the lattice path of $S$ with respect to $H_{5,7}$ is $P = \{(0,3), (1,2), (3,1), (4,0)\}$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 16,17,71,72 \rangle$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(16,17,71,72);
<Numerical semigroup with 4 generators>
```

Given a numerical semigroup $S$ and two integers $p,q$ such that $\gcd (p,q) = 1$, the function `LatticePathAssociatedToNumericalSemigroup` returns the lattice path of $S$ with respect to $H_{p,q}$.

``` gap
gap> LatticePathAssociatedToNumericalSemigroup(S, 16, 17);
[ [ 0, 14 ], [ 1, 13 ], [ 2, 12 ], [ 3, 11 ], [ 4, 10 ], [ 5, 9 ], [ 6, 8 ],
  [ 7, 7 ], [ 8, 6 ], [ 9, 5 ], [ 10, 4 ], [ 11, 3 ], [ 12, 2 ], [ 13, 1 ],
  [ 14, 0 ] ]
```

The result is as follows.

::: {style="text-align:center;"}
![Lattice path of $S$ with respect to $H_{16, 17}$.](../Images/Image_example2_lattice_path.png){width="300px" height="300px"}
:::

As before, the red line denotes the line $ax + by = c-1$ and the blue points are the coordinates of the gaps of $S$.

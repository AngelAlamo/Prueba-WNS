## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](Numerical-semigroup.qmd). It is well known that every numerical semigroup admits a unique finite [minimal system of generators](Minimal-set-of-generators.qmd) $B = \{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_p\}$ for some $p \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$. The embedding dimension is defined as the cardinal of the minimal system of generators, and it is denoted by $e(S)$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \{0, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, \rightarrow\}$. First, we will compute the minimal system of generators of $S$. The [multiplicity](Multiplicity.qmd) of $S$ is $m(S) = 3$ and is always a minimal generator. On the other hand, the number $7$ cannot be generated by $3$, then $7$ is another minimal generator. Considering the generators system $B = {3, 7}$, we obtain $S$, therefore, $e(S) = |B| = 2$.

$\circ$ Let $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ arbitrary but fixed and $S = \langle m, m+1, m+2, \ldots, 2m - 1 \rangle$. It is easy to see that $B = \{m, m+1, m+2, \ldots, 2m - 1\}$ is a minimal system of generators of $S$, therefore $e(S) = m = m(S)$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 5, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 29, 35, 50 \rangle$, in GAP:

```{GAP}
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(5, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 29, 35, 50);

<Numerical semigroup with 9 generators>

```

The function `EmbeddingDimension` computes the embedding dimension of $S$.

```{GAP}
gap> EmbeddingDimension(S);

4
```

Using the `MinimalGenerators` function, we can also obtain the minimal system of generators of $S$.

```{GAP}
gap> MinimalGenerators(S);

[ 5, 12, 18, 19 ]

```

We conclude that $e(S) = |\{5, 12, 18, 19\}| = 4$. Note that $e(S)$ is less than the multiplicity ($m(S) = 5$), this property holds for any numerical semigroup.

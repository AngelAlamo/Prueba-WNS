## Definition

Let $A = \{m_1, \ldots, m_r\}$ be a subset of positive integers and let $A_1, A_2$ be a partition of $A$. For each $B = \{ m_{i_1}, \ldots, m_{i_k} \} \in \{A, A_1, A_2\}$, let us consider $X_B = \{x_i ~ | ~ m_i \in B\}$, the free monoid of $B$,

$$
Free(X_B) = \{a_1x_{i_1} + \cdots + a_kx_{i_k} ~ | ~ a_1, \ldots, a_k \in \mathbb{N}\},
$$

the monoid homomorfism,

$$
\phi_B: Free(X_B) \to \mathbb{N}, ~~ a_1x_{i_1} + \cdots + x_{i_k}a_k \to a_1 m_{i_1} + \cdots + a_k m_{i_k}.
$$

and the [kernel congruence](../Presentations-NS/Presentation-NS.qmd) of $\phi_B$. Then, it is said that $A$ is a gluing of $A_1$ and $A_2$ if there exists a system of generators $\rho$ of $\sigma$ such that $\rho = \rho_1 \cup \rho_2 \cup \{(a,b)\}$ with $\rho_1 \subseteq \sigma_{A_1}, \rho_2 \subseteq \sigma_{A_2}$, $0 \ne a \in Free(X_{A_1})$ and $0 \ne b \in Free(X_{A_2})$.

It can be proven that $A$ is a gluing of $A_1$ and $A_2$ if, and only if, for $d_1 = gcd(A_1)$ and $d_2 = gcd(A_2)$, then $lcm(d_1, d_2) = \langle A_1 \rangle \cap \langle A_2 \rangle$, where $gcd(\cdot)$ denotes the great common divisor and $lcm(\cdot)$ denotes the least common multiple.

The gluing of a set of positive integers is closely related to the concept of [gluing of numerical semigroups](../Families-NS/NS-Gluing.qmd).

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $A = \{15, 25, 24, 36\}$ and let us consider the partition $A_1 = \{15, 25\}$, $A_2 = \{24, 36\}$. We have $gcd(A_1) = 5, gcd(A_2) = 12$ and $lcm(5, 12) = 60 \in \langle 15, 25 \rangle \cap \langle 24, 36 \rangle$. Therefore, $A$ is a gluing of $A_1, A_2$. A system of generators of $\sigma_1$ is $\{(3x_2,5x_1)\}$ and for $\sigma_2$ is $\{(2x_4, 3x_3)\}$. Moreover, there is the relation $(4x_1, x_3 + x_4) \in \sigma_{A}$, where $a = 4x_1 \in Free(X_{A_1}) \setminus \{0\}$ and $b = x_3 + x_4 \in Free(X_{A_2}) \setminus \{0\}$. A system of generators of $\sigma_A$ is

$$
\rho = \{(3x_2, 5x_1), (2x_4, 3x_3), (4x_1, x_3 + x_4)\}.
$$

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to gluing of a set of positive integers.

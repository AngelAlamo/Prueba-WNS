## Definition

We say that $(S,+)$ is a numerical semigroup if $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and satisfies the following conditions:

1.  For all $a,b \in S$, then $a + b \in S$.

2.  $0 \in S$.

3.  The set $\mathbb{N} \setminus S$ is finite.

The first two conditions implies that $(S,+)$ is a submonoid of $(\mathbb{N}, +)$ and if there is no confusion, we denote the numerical semigroup as $S$. The set formed by the non-zero elements of $S$ is denoted by $S^*$. Equivalently, $(S, +)$ is a numerical semigroup if $(S,+)$ is a submonoid of $(\mathbb{N}, +)$ and $1 \in G$, where $G = \{x - y ~ | ~ x,y \in S \}$.

As the complement is finite, there must be a $c \in S$ such that for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $c+n \in S$, this value $c \in S$ is called the [conductor](Conductor.qmd) of the semigroup and it is usually denoted by $C(S)$. If $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n \in S$ are the elements smaller than the conductor (called [left elements](Left-elements.qmd)), then we write the numerical semigroup as $S = \{0, s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n, C(S), \rightarrow \}$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let us consider a non-zero $m \in \mathbb{N}$ arbitrary but fixed. The set $S = \mathbb{N} \setminus \{1, 2, \ldots, m-1\}$ is a numerical semigroup, and if we use the previous notation, $S = \{0, m, \rightarrow \}$.

$\circ$ Consider the submonoid generated by the set $A = \{4,5\}$, that means, $S = \langle 4, 5 \rangle$. Computing the first elements, we see that $\{0, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12\} \subseteq S$ and for any element $n \in \mathbb{N}$ so that $n \ge 12$, it holds $n \in S$. In conclusion, $S$ is a numerical semigroup and $S = \{0, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12 \rightarrow \}$.

$\circ$ Consider the submonoid generated by the set $A = \{5, 7, 11\}$, that means, $S = \langle 5, 7, 11 \rangle$. If we compute the first elements, we obtain that $\{0, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14\} \subseteq S$ and the conductor is $C(S) = 14$, therefore, $S = \{0, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, \rightarrow \}$.

## Examples with GAP

The following examples are made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP. The function `NumericalSemigroups` returns the numerical semigroups generated from a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ if possible, since not every set $A$ generates a numerical semigroup, a sufficient and necessary condition is that $gcd(A) = 1$.

$\diamond$ We define the following numerical semigroup in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroups(9, 11, 12);
<Numerical semigroup with 3 generators>
```

We can obtain the left elements and the conductor with the function `SmallElements`.

``` gap
gap> Smallelements(S);
[ 0, 9, 11, 12, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38 ]
```

We conclude that $S = \{ 0, 9, 11, 12, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, \rightarrow \}$.

$\diamond$ If we try to define a semigroup with the set $A = \{12, 15, 21\}$, we obtain the following output:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroups(12, 15, 21);
Error, The greatest common divisor is not 1.
```

As we can see, $gcd(12, 15, 21) = 3$, that implies that $S = \langle 12, 15, 21 \rangle \subseteq \langle 3 \rangle$, but the set $\mathbb{N} \setminus \langle 3 \rangle$ is infinite, therefore $\mathbb{N} \setminus S$ is also infinite and $S$ is not a numerical semigroup.

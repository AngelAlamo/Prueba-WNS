## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) other than $\mathbb{N}$ and [minimally generated](Minimal-set-of-generators.qmd) by $P = \{n_1, \ldots, n_p\}$ with $n_1 < n_2 < \cdots < n_p$. It is defined the ratio of $S$ as $n_2$, and it is denoted by $r(S)$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 6, 12, 14, 15 \rangle$. Since $12 = 2 \cdot 6$, the set $B = \{6, 12, 14, 15\}$ is not a minimal system of generators and $12$ is not the ratio. It is easy to deduce that $B\setminus \{12\}$ is minimal. Then, the ratio of $S$ is $r(S) = 14$.

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to ratio of a numerical semigroup. However, given a numerical semigroup, the following function returns its ratio.

``` gap
gap> RatioNumericalSemigroup := function(S)
>       if IsNumericalSemigroup(S) = false then
>               return "Input must be a Numerical Semigroup";
>       elif 1 in S then
>               return "Numerical Semigroup must be other than N";
>       else
>               return MinimalGenerators(S)[2];
>       fi;
> end;
function( S ) ... end
```

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 18, 36, 37, 40, 72 \rangle$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(18, 36, 37, 40, 72);
<Numerical semigroup with 5 generators>
```

Given a numerical semigroup $S$, the function `MinimalGenerators` returns a list with the minimal generators of $S$.

``` gap
gap> MinimalGenerators(S);
[ 18, 37, 40 ]
```

Then, the ratio of $S$ is $r(S) = 37$. With the function defined above,

``` gap
gap> RatioNumericalSemigroup(S);
37
gap> T := NumericalSemigroup(1);
<The numerical semigroup N>
gap> RatioNumericalSemigroup(T);
"Numerical Semigroup must be other than N"
gap> RatioNumericalSemigroup(2);
"Input must be a Numerical Semigroup"
```

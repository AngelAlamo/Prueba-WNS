## Definition

Let $S$ a [numerical semigroup](Numerical-semigroup.qmd) and $n \in S^*$. It is defined the Apéry set of $S$ with respect to $n$, denoted by $Ap(S,n)$, to be the set

$$
Ap(S,n) = \{s \in S ~ | ~ s - n \not \in S\}.
$$

The knowledge of this set determines completely the numerical semigroup $S$. Ap(S,n) always have $n$ elements and it is easy to obtain the [Frobenius number](Frobenius-number.qmd), the [multiplicity](Multiplicity.qmd) and the [genus](Genus.qmd) of $S$ from this set. This definition could be extended to the [Apéry-set-integer](Apery-set-integer.qmd).

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 3, 8, 10 \rangle$, or equivalently, $S = \{0, 3, 6, 8, \rightarrow \}$, lets compute the Apéry set of $S$ with respect to $n = 3$. All the elements greater or equal than $11$ cannot be in the Apéry set. Indeed, the [conductor](Basic-concepts/Conductor.qmd) of $S$ is $C(S) = 8$ and if $n \ge 11$, $n - 3 \ge 11 - 3 = 8$, in conclusion, $n-3 \in S$. With the above reasoning, we have that $Ap(S, 3) \subseteq \{0, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11\}$, and if we check the condition with every element, we obtain that $Ap(S,3) = \{0, 8, 10\}$.

$\circ$ Consider $S = \langle 4, 6, 11, 13 \rangle$ and $n = 6$. It is easy to see that $S = \{0, 4, 6, 8, 10, \rightarrow \}$, and applying the same argument as in the previous example, we have that $Ap(S,6) \subseteq \{0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\}$. If we check for every number, it follows that $Ap(S,6) = \{0, 4, 8, 11, 13, 15\}$.

## Examples with GAP

The following examples are made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Consider $S = \langle 12, 14, 25, 33 \rangle$, in GAP:

```{GAP}
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(12, 14, 25, 33);

<Numerical semigroup with 4 generators>

```

We can use the function `AperyListOfNumericalSemigroupWRTElement` in order to compute the Apéry set of $S$ for any $n \in S^*$.

```{GAP}
gap> AperyListOfNumericalSemigroupWRTElement(S, 12);

[0, 25, 14, 39, 28, 53, 42, 67, 56, 33, 58, 47]

```

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 6,7,8,9 \rangle$. We first compute the [left elements](Left-elements.qmd) and the [conductor](Conductor.qmd) of $S$ with the function `SmallElements`.

```{GAP}
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(6,7,8,9);

<Numerical semigroup with 4 generators>

gap> SmallElements(S);

[ 0, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 ]

```

We have that $S = \{0, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, \rightarrow \}$. Now we calculate the Apéry set of $S$ with $n = 6$.

```{GAP}
gap> AperyListOfNumericalSemigroupWRTElement(S, 6);

[ 0, 7, 8, 9, 16, 17 ]

```

As we say before, the Apéry set determines completely the numerical semigroup. The function `NumericalSemigroupByAperyList` returns the numerical semigroup from the Apéry set.

```{GAP}

gap> T := NumericalSemigroupByAperyList([ 0, 7, 8, 9, 16, 17 ]);

<Numerical semigroup>

gap> SmallElements(T);

[ 0, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 ]

```

Thus, $S = \{0, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, \rightarrow \} = T$ and the result holds. The function `IsAperyListOfNumericalSemigroup` tests whether a list of integers may represent the Apéry set of a numerical semigroup, in this case:

```{GAP}
gap> IsAperyListOfNumericalSemigroup([ 0, 7, 8, 9, 16, 17 ]);

true

```

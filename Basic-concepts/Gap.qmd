## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](Numerical-semigroup.qmd). By definition, the set $\mathbb{N} \setminus S$ is finite, then it is said that a natural is a gap of $S$ if it belongs to $\mathbb{N} \setminus S$. The set of gaps is usually denoted by $G(S)$, and its cardinal, the [genus](Genus.qmd) of $S$, by $g(S)$. Note that the gaps determine completely the numerical semigroup. The maximum of $G(S)$ is the [Frobenius number](Frobenius-number.qmd) of $S$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 4, 9, 10 \rangle$. If we compute the first elements of $S$, we arrive that $S = \{0, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, \rightarrow \}$, then $G(S) = \mathbb{N} \setminus S = \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16\}$ and $G(S) = \{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 15\}$.

$\circ$ Let $b \in \mathbb{N}$ an odd element arbitrary but fixed. The set $S = \langle 2, b \rangle$ is a numerical semigroup (note that if $n \ge b$, then $n \in S$) and the gaps of $S$ are $G(S) = \{1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots, b - 2\}$, in other words, all the odd naturals smaller than $b$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 5, 23, 24, 33, 34 \rangle$, in GAP:

```{GAP}
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(5, 23, 24, 33, 34);

<Numerical semigroup with 5 generators>

```

To compute the set of gaps of $S$ we can apply the function `Gaps`.

```{GAP}
gap> Gaps(S);

[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27, 31, 32, 36, 37, 41, 42 ]

```

Note that if we know all the elements between $0$ and $F(S)+1$ that belongs to $S$, where $F(S)$ denote the Frobenius number of $S$, then we also know the gaps of $S$, in GAP, we can compute it with the function `SmallElements`:

```{GAP}
gap> SmallElements(S);

[ 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 40, 43 ]

```

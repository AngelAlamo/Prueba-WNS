## Definition

Let $X$ be a non-empty set of $\mathbb{N}$ with $gcd(X) = 1$. It is well known that the condition $gcd(X) = 1$ is sufficient for $\langle X \rangle$ to be a numerical semigroup. Moreover, every Arf semigroup that contains $X$ must contain $\langle X \rangle$. Then, it is defined the Arf closure of $X$ as the [Arf closure](Arf-closure.qmd) of $S = \langle X \rangle$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $X = \{4, 6, 9\}$ and $S = \langle X \rangle = \langle 4, 6, 9 \rangle$. The set of oversemigroups is

$$
\mathcal{O}(S) = \{\mathbb{N}, \{0, 2, \rightarrow \}, \{0, 2, 4, \rightarrow \}, \{0, 2, 4, 6, \rightarrow\}, \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, \rightarrow \}, \{0, 3, \rightarrow \},
$$

$$
\{0, 3, 4, 6, \rightarrow \}, \{0, 4, \rightarrow \}, \{0, 4, 5, 6, 8, \rightarrow \}, \{0, 4, 6, \rightarrow \}, \{0, 4, 6, 8, \rightarrow \}, S \}.
$$

Moreover, the Arf semigroups are

$$
T_0 = \mathbb{N}, T_1 = \{0, 2, \rightarrow \}, T_2 = \{0, 2, 4, \rightarrow \}, T_3 = \{0, 2, 4, 6, \rightarrow \}, T_4 = \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, \rightarrow \}, 
$$

$$
T_5 = \{0, 3, \rightarrow \}, T_6 = \{0, 4, \rightarrow \}, T_7 = \{0, 4, 6, \rightarrow \}, T_8 = \{0, 4, 6, 8, \rightarrow \}.
$$

Therefore, the Arf closure of $X$ is $A = \bigcap_{i = 0}^8 T_i = \{0, 4, 6, 8, \rightarrow \} = S \cup \{11\}$. In this case, the Arf closure of $X$ is the numerical semigroup $\langle X \rangle$ to which its [Frobenius number](Frobenius-number.qmd) has been added.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $X = \{4, 13, 18, 23\}$ and $S = \langle X \rangle$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> x := [4, 13, 18, 23];
[ 4, 13, 18, 23 ]
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(x);
<Numerical semigroup with 4 generators>
```

The functions `ArfClosure` and `ArfNumericalSemigroupClosure` compute the Arf closure of a numerical semigroup.

``` gap
gap> A := ArfClosure(S);
<Numerical semigroup>
gap> ArfClosure(S) = ArfNumericalSemigroupClosure(S);
true
```

We can use the function `SmallElements` to compute the [left elements](Left-elements.qmd) and the [conductor](Conductor.qmd) of a numerical semigroup.

``` gap
gap> SmallElements(A)
[ 0, 4, 8, 12 ]
```

Therefore, the Arf closure of $X$ is $A = \{0, 4, 8, 12, \rightarrow\}$.

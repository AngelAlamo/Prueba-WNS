## Definition

Let $S$ be a semigroup. It is said that $S$ is multiple joined if for all $x, y \in S$, there exist positive integers $p$ and $q$ such that $px = qy$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Given a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) $S$, then $S^* = S \setminus \{0\}$ is multiple joined.

$\circ$ Every multiple joined semigroup is [Archimedean](Archimedean-property.qmd). Given $x, y \in S$, there exist $p, q \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ such that $px = qy$. Then, $(p+1)x = qy+x$ and $S$ is Archimedean.

## Definition

Let $A$ be a monoid. It is said that $A$ is a cancellative monoid if for any $a, b, c \in A$ such that $a + c = b + c$, it holds $a = b$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Every group is a cancellative monoid since every element has an inverse.

$\circ$ Let $R$ be an unitary ring and let us consider $A = (M_2(R), \cdot)$, where $M_2(R)$ is the set of $2 \times 2$ matrix with coefficients in $R$ and $\cdot$ denotes the usual matrix product. It is well known that $A$ is a monoid. We have that

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 0 \\
  1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 0 \\
  1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 \\
  1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 0 \\
  1 & 0
\end{pmatrix},
$$

where it is deduced that $(M_2(R), \cdot)$ is not a cancellative monoid.

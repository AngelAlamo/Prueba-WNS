## Definition

Let $S$ be a [cancellative](M-cancellative.qmd) monoid. It is defined the relation $\sim$ on $S \times S$ as follows:

$$
(a, b) \sim (c, d) \Longleftrightarrow a + d = b + c.
$$

It can be proven that the relation $\sim$ is a [congruence](Congruence-on-a-semigroup.qmd). It is defined the quotient group, denoted by $Q(S)$, as $Q(S) = (S \times S)/ \sim$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = (\mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}, \cdot)$. Then,

$$
(a,b) \sim (c,d) \Longleftrightarrow ad = bc.
$$

It is well known that the relation defined above on $\mathbb{Z} \times (\mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\})$ generates the quotient field of $\mathbb{Z}$, which is $D(\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Q}$. Since $(0,n) \sim (0,1)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}$, it is deduced that $Q(S) = (S \times S) / \sim \hspace{0.1cm} = D(\mathbb{Z}) \setminus \{[(0,1)]\}$.

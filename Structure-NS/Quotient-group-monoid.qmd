## Definition

Let $A$ be a [cancellative](M-cancellative.qmd) monoid. It is defined the relation $\sim$ on $S \times S$ as follows:

$$
(a, b) \sim (c, d) \Longleftrightarrow a + d = b + c.
$$

It can be proven that the relation $\sim$ is a congruence. It is defined the quotient group, denoted by $Q(S)$, as $Q(S) = (S \times S)/ \sim$.

## Examples

$\circ$

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to quotient group of a monoid.

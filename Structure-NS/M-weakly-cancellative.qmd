## Definition

Let $A$ be a monoid. It is said that $A$ is weakly cancellative if given $x, y \in A$ such that $x + a = y + a$ for all $a \in A \setminus \{0\}$, it holds $x = y$.

## Examples

$\circ$

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to weakly cancellative monoid.

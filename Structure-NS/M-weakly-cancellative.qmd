## Definition

Let $A$ be a monoid. It is said that $A$ is weakly cancellative if given $x, y \in A$ such that $x + a = y + a$ for all $a \in A \setminus \{0\}$, it holds $x = y$.

## Examples

$\circ$ If $A$ is a [cancellative monoid](M-cancellative.qmd), then it is a weakly cancellative monoid.

$\circ$ Let $R$ be an unitary ring and let us consider $A = (M_2(R), \cdot)$, where $M_2(R)$ denotes the set of $2 \times 2$ matrix with coefficients in $R$ and $\cdot$ denotes the usual matrix product. Let us suppose that there exist $A,B \in M_2(R)$ such that for all $C \in M_2(R) \setminus \{Id\}$, it holds $AC = BC$. Let us consider

$$
C_{1,1} = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$ 

If $AC = BC$, then $a_{1,1}c_{1,1} + a_{1,2}c_{2,1} = b_{1,1}c_{1,1} + b_{1,2}c_{2,1}$, and consequently $a_{1,1} = b_{1,1}$. With an analogous argument it is obtained that $a_{i,j} = b_{i,j}$ for $i,j \in \{1,2\}$, concluding that $A = B$. Therefore, $(M_2(R), \cdot)$ is a weakly cancellative monoid.

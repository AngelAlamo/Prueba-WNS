## Definition

Let $A$ be a monoid. It is said that $A$ is a $\mathcal{R}-$monoid if it is a [cancellative monoid](M-cancellative.qmd) that is not a group and with at least an [Archimedean element](Archimedean-property.qmd).

## Examples

$\circ$ $(\mathbb{N}, +)$ is an $\mathcal{R}-$monoid. In particular, every [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) is a $\mathcal{R}-$monoid.

$\circ$ Let $R$ be an unitary ring and $A = (M_2(R), \cdot)$, where $M_2(R)$ is the set of $2 \times 2$ matrix with coefficients in $R$ and $\cdot$ denotes the usual product matrix. Since $A$ is not cancellative, $A$ is not a $\mathcal{R}-$monoid.

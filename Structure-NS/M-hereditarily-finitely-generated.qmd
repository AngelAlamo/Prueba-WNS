## Definition

Let $A$ be a monoid. It is said that $A$ is a hereditarily finitely generated monoid if every submonoid is finitely generated.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let us consider $A = (\mathbb{N}, +)$ and $X$ a submonoid of $A$. Let $d = gcd(X)$ and $S = \left \{\frac{x}{d} ~ | ~ x \in X \right\}$. Since $gcd(S) = 1$, it is well known that $S$ is a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) and it has a [minimal set of generators](../Basic-concepts/Minimal-set-of-generators.qmd) $P$. Then, $dP = \{dp ~ | ~ p \in P\}$ is a set of generators of $X$ and $A$ is a hereditarily finitely generated monoid.

## Definition

Let $S$ be a semigroup. it is said that $S$ is torsion free if for any positive integer $k$ and $a,b \in S$ such that $ka = kb$, then $a = b$.

It can be proven that a commutative monoid $A$ is isomorphic to a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) if, and only if, $A$ is finitely generated, [quasi-Archimedean](M-quasi-Archimedean.qmd), [torsion free](S-torsion-free.qmd) and with only one idempotent.

## Examples

$\circ$ Every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is torsion free, in particular, every numerical semigroup is torsion free.

## Examples with GAP

Nowadays, there are no functions in package NumericalSgps related to torsion free semigroup.

## Definition

Let $S$ be a semigroup. It is said that $S$ is torsion free if for any positive integer $k$ and $a,b \in S$ such that $ka = kb$, then $a = b$.

It can be proven that a commutative monoid $A$ is isomorphic to a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) if, and only if, $A$ is finitely generated, [quasi-Archimedean](M-quasi-Archimedean.qmd), [torsion free](S-torsion-free.qmd) and with only one idempotent.

## Examples

$\circ$ Every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is torsion free, in particular, every numerical semigroup is torsion free.

$\circ$ Let $S_3$ the group of permutations with three elements. If we consider the permutations $\sigma_1 = (1,2), \sigma_2 = (2,3)$, we have that $2\sigma_1 = \sigma_1 \circ \sigma_1 = Id = \sigma_2 \circ \sigma_2 = 2\sigma_2$, but $\sigma_1 \ne \sigma_2$. Then, $S_3$ is not a torsion free semigroup.

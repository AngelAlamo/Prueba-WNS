## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd) [minimally generated](../Basic-concepts/Minimal-set-of-generators.qmd) by $\{n_1, \ldots, n_e\}$, and let $n \in S$. It is defined the graph associated to $n$ in $S$, denoted by $G_n = (V_n, E_n)$, as the graph with vertices

$$
V_n = \{n_i ~ | ~ n - n_i \in S\},
$$

and edges,

$$
E_n = \{\{n_i, n_j\} ~ | ~ n - (n_i + n_j) \in S, i \ne j\}.
$$
